There are a few ways to remove the latest migration in Django. Here's how you can do it:

### Method 1: Delete the migration file and roll back the database

1. First, find the latest migration file in your app's migrations folder:
   ```
   your_app/migrations/
   ```

2. Delete the latest migration file (e.g., `0005_auto_20250319_1234.py`).

3. Roll back the database to the previous migration:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate your_app 0004_previous_migration_name
   ```

### Method 2: Use `--fake` to revert the migration

1. First, roll back the database to the previous migration using the `--fake` flag:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate your_app 0004_previous_migration_name --fake
   ```

2. Then delete the migration file you want to remove.

### Method 3: Using `django-extensions` (if installed)

If you have `django-extensions` installed, you can use:
```
python manage.py reset_migrations your_app
```

### Method 4: SQLite specific approach

If you're using SQLite for development, you can:
1. Delete the migration file
2. Delete the database file (db.sqlite3)
3. Run migrations again:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Important considerations:

1. Never delete migrations in a production environment or when working with a team
2. Make sure you're not removing migrations that other team members have already applied
3. If you've already committed the migration to version control, rolling it back might be better than deleting it
4. If your database contains important data, make a backup before manipulating migrations
